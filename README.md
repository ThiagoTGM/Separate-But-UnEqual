# Separate-But-UnEqual
Author: Thiago Marback

The objective of this project is to show the increased hurdles that African Americans face in their lives due to the racism that permeates our society.
It first shows this in the early 1960s, famous for the struggle against legal segregation. Then it shows the modern situation, demonstrating that, despite claims of the contrary, racism is still very much alive.

The events depicted here are not meant to explicitly correlate to particular real events, but they are all based on real cases of racism.
