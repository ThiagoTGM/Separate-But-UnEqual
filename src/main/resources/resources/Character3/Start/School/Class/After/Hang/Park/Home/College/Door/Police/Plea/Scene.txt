You strike a deal to confess to the crime you didn't commit, in exchange for getting parole instead of prison.
However, once you are back, your boss fires you for being a criminal.
You also get a notice that, due to your conviction, you became ineligible for the public housing you currently live in.
Now jobless and soon to be homeless, you worry about the future.
