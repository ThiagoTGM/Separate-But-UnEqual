In class, the teacher mentions:
"The year is almost ending, so you have to think about what you are going to do after school!"
You ponder about your options:
Go straight to work, trying to help your family;
Go to a local black college, which is not really known to be of the best quality, but it is something;
Try to enroll at the state college, which is extremely well-known, and which had just received a legal order to allow students of color to enroll.
